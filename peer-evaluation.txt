What is something you learned by reviewing your peer's project?
He has concise codes and it works perfectly. I like his style of codes.

What is something you saw in your peer's project that you would like to apply to your own programming projects?
He puts all of variables at the very beginning and this is a lot of easier to check if there is something wrong. Also his work has very descriptive README file. 
 

What suggestions would you have for your peer to improve his/her code?
I think he can add some comments to his work. Comments are very helpful. It helps you organize your work and remain something you may forget.
 

What could have been clearer or better commented?
There is no comments on his work. If he can add some comments that will be perfect.

Was there anything in the code that was confusing to you? If so, what?
The hp of each enemies is 120 and each bullet will cause 6 damage. When I test it I find that I need to shoot 21 times in order to kill one enemy and points of the last shoot will not be count. I am confusing.
 

Does the repository contain an appropriate LICENSE?
Yes it does.
 

What is something he/she could add to the README.md to make it more descriptive?
He wrote a lot on README file. I think it is already descriptive.

Pay a compliment to your peer based on the quality of his/her code.
Overall, it's a great work. Very descriptive README file and concise code. I like the style of your codes and I think you can add some comments to your work next time.
