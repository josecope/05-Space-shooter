Peer's repository: Joey Copeland



What is something you learned by reviewing your peer's project?
    Joey's code is simple and easy to read as opposed to my own code.
 

What is something you saw in your peer's project that you would like to apply to your own programming projects?
    It's important to make your own code easy to sort through in case you want to add anything or need to
    get rid of a bug. I also should've considered adding a background photo to mine, even though I don't know
    how to do it.
 

What suggestions would you have for your peer to improve his/her code?
    One thing you could do would have the bullets shoot from your
    spaceship as long as you are holding down your mouse, not just
    when you initially press it, especially since it takes so many
    bullets to kill a single enemy.

What could have been clearer or better commented?
    Nothing! Everything was very clear and easy to understand.
 

Was there anything in the code that was confusing to you? If so, what?
    No, the code was very clear and easy to understand.
 

Does the repository contain an appropriate LICENSE?
    Yes.
 

What is something he/she could add to the README.md to make it more descriptive?
    Nothing! The README.md file does a good job describing the objective of the
    assignment and the game.

Pay a compliment to your peer based on the quality of his/her code.
    Joey's code is very easy to understand and organized. Overall the game is
    really good, nice job!
